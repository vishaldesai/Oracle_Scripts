x$kffxp <- asm logical to physical mapping cached in sga

v$cell_thread_history is like ash for cell server
cth.sql - have last 10 minutes of data. working status means on cpu

@sqlid
@sqlidx

v$iostat_function_details - io types by processes

cellio.sql

x$kcboqh - buffers in buffer cache per segment

@kcbbes - checkpoint reasons and buffer counts

cellsrvstat - statspack for cell server

@ash/event_hist

list topcpu 2 ,16,6000 detail - most expensive cpu consuming sql statements

@sp - spfile parameter set

@ash/shortmon log - short wait event monitor 

In Exadata, access predicate is a filter predicate for table.

Real Time SQL Monitoring duration -> start of execution to last fetch (includes fetch time)

Each sample in sql monitoring is approx 1 second.

elapsed time is not duration but it is database time (fetch is not included).

Time Active -> Timeline -> When particular line was started and when was it active
							 Active -> when it was started
							 Duration -> how long it ran
							 
11.2.0.4 -> has flash cache write metrics. until 11.2.0.3 flash cache writes were included in 
flash cache read.

iostat:
avgqu-sz -> queue length -> number of requests queued up in devices
await -> IO wait before its serviced

@event_hist.sql
@event_hist_cell.sql
@ashtop.sql

exastat.py -> reports storage cell metrics little bit better.

Flash:
flash behaviour has changed in latest version.
@exadata/cellpd

cell smart flash unkeep -> flush or invalidate flash cache -> when we see this wait event its waiting
for flash invalidation to complete.

smart scan by pass flash cache unless cell_flash_cache is KEEP (large IO).

write back flash cache is mirrored.
